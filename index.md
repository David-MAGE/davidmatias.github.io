# Edilberto David Matias Garcia

<span class="badge">Economics consultant</span>

I’m an economist at the Inter-American Development Bank. With degrees in economics from El Colegio de Mexico (Master's) and the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico (Bachelor's).  

Some of my research interests include:

- Industrial Organization  
- Environmental Economics  
- Applied Econometrics  
- Market Design  
- Regulation  
- Energy markets  
- Development Economics  

My work at the IDB has focused on these areas. I've also actively participated in webinars, courses, conferences, and dialogues with governments and regulatory agencies across Latin America and the Caribbean to discuss energy challenges and opportunities.

As I look toward the future, I'm keen to pursue a PhD to further my academic interests and continue contributing to the field of environmental and energy economics.
